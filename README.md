# Project Overview

To view this project you can either open the live version at: https://scoopkm.github.io/Feed-Reader/ or download/clone the repo and open index.html. This projects covers using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) to write test suites to test the functionality of your code before you even write it. This is a good way to ensure that when you add new features it does not break already existing ones, and that your code performs in the way you intended.

<b>Important Note:</b> If you are not familiar with the jQuery library for JavaScript, I would recommended brushing up on it at [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp), since the majority of this project is written in jQuery syntax, and will be hard to understand without the background knowledge.  


## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!


## Instructions on How to Make Your Own Feed Reader
If you would like to make your own Feed Reader you can download/fork Udacity's repo for this project [here](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader).

Once you have downloaded/forked the repo, all instructions on what you need to do to expand the test suites capabilities are detailed in the README.md and in comments in the feedreader.js file. Here's a link to the [project's rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/3442558598/rubric) to ensure your version of the Feed Reader would meet Udacity's standards.
